# pi-rover
A POC for a robotic vehicle on Rasperry Pi Zero and Python

There are two subprojects that have been developed herein:
- rover - a four-wheeled vehicle
- robby - a 2DOF robot arm

The vehicle was developed first. The intention was kind of to include
a camera that could be robotically pan and tilted to survey the current location
of the vehicle and in the future provide CV to navigate the vehicle.

These aims diverged a bit and this repo is a bit mixed up.

## Hardware
- Raspberry Pi Zero W V1.1
- Kingston SDC4/16GB Micro SD card
- Sparkfun Pi Servo Shield - DEV-14328
- Pan-tilt kit
- Tower Pro Micro Servo SG90 9 g

### SG90 specs
I've found that (at least the ones I got) are rather crappy.
They are highly non-linear.

- 5 V
- 20 ms (50 Hz) PWM base
- Pulse width encoding:
- 1.0 ms: -90 degrees CCW (left)
- 1.5 ms: 0 degrees (middle)
- 2.0 ms: 90 degrees CW (right)

> The linearity of these cheap "Tower Pro" servos is very poor.
> Going to try "Miuzei" MS-18, with reportedly better
> linearity and no offest drift.

### PCA9685 specs
This is actually designed for LED PWM control, but can be used for servos.
It can control 16 output channels.
PWM control for each channel is 12-bit (4096 steps).

Drive capability at 5 V:
- 25 mA sink open drain/totem pole
- 10 mA source totem pole

The internal 25 MHz oscillator is not very accurate.
That coupled with the granularity of the scaler, pulse
widths can not be controlled precisely. With pre scaler
register set 121, observed 18.28 ms instead of 20 for
50 Hz.

Power on reset sets output to LOW.

## Pi Zero W basics
Login via ssh:

``ssh root@raspberrypi0-wifi.local``

``ssh pi:raspberry@raspberry.local``

> Wait about 60 s for the RPI0Z to boot up, when the green LED stops flashing.

## File sharing
In order to use IntelliJ on Mac, set up a share.

In Mac File Sharing > Options, need to:
 - allow RPI filder to be shared
 - allow user for Windows File Sharing

Tip: copy the following to /home/pi/connect-mac:

sudo mount -t cifs //Franks-MacBook-Pro.local/RPI Projects/RPI -o user=frankw,uid=pi

Determine OS X hostname: ``hostname -a``

Then on Pi, ls ~/Projects/RPI will show empty directories.

Then cd ~/Projects/RPI/pi-rover and the project directory.

Then python src/main/pan-tilt.py

## Running pi-gpio
This is the gpio version.

> Initial development was with pi-gpio, but latest is using smbus. see src/main/robby/pan-tilt.py

Update on pi:

scp -r ./src pi@192.168.1.116:/home/pi/Projects/pi-rover

Shell into the pi
cd /home/pi/Projects/pi-rover
sudo pigpiod
python src/main/pi-pigpio.py

RPi.GPIO uses software PWM

## Wiring
On Pi Zero, the two outermost pins near the SD card are +5V

CK1122 to Pi Zero

| GND | BLACK  | GND06  |
| +5V | RED    | 5V02   |
| IN1 | ORANGE | GPIO26 |
| ENA | YELLOW | GPIO19 |
| IN2 | GREEN  | GPIO13 |
| CSA | BLUE   | NC     |
| IN3 | VIOLET | GPIO23
| ENB | GRAY   | GPIO18 |
| IN4 | WHITE  | GPIO24 |
| CSB | BROWN  | NC     |

## Raspberry Pi
Well, it's kind of neat to have a full OS, but there are some downsides:

- long boot time (not really long, but too many seconds)
- not a real time OS (maybe there are variants)
- hardware PWM may require low-level language support

## Motors with PWM
I got generic motors, but they look like DAGU

The gear train is a bit noisy.

### PWM frequncies
Initally tried 100 Hz with python pigpio.

| 100 | maybe a bit of dwell at low, can hear the buzz at low values, some glitches |
| 1000 | high pitched, doesn't reach full speed |
| 500 | like 1000 |
| 27 | rough, glitched are more pronounced |
| 200 | like 100 |

PWM prescale of 121 results in 54.6 Hz

## Bluetooth
Got a linux image with BT support baked with the yocto-pi-vm project.
Haven't been able to get hci0 up during startup, so added a script ``setup-bt.sh`` to run manually after boot.

The ``dbus-bt.py`` script successfully advertises, but not much else yet.
